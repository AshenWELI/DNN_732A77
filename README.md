Deep Neural Networks Laboration
Data used in this laboration are from the Kitsune Network Attack Dataset, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Kitsune+Network+Attack+Dataset . We will focus on the 'Mirai' part of the dataset. Your task is to make a DNN that can classify if each attack is benign or malicious. The dataset has 116 covariates, but to make it a bit more difficult we will remove the first 24 covariates.

You need to answer all questions in this notebook.

If the training is too slow on your own computer, use the smaller datasets (*half or *quarter).

Dense networks are not optimal for tabular datasets like the one used here, but here the main goal is to learn deep learning.
